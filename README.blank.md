## rspec-puppet-augeas

This module includes the [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) configuration to use [`rspec-puppet-augeas`](https://github.com/domcleal/rspec-puppet-augeas) to test and verify changes made to files using the [`augeas` resource](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#augeas) available in Puppet. Check the `rspec-puppet-augeas` [documentation](https://github.com/domcleal/rspec-puppet-augeas/blob/master/README.md) for usage.

This will require a copy of the original input files to `spec/fixtures/augeas` using the same filesystem layout that the resource expects:

    $ tree spec/fixtures/augeas/
    spec/fixtures/augeas/
    `-- etc
        `-- ssh
            `-- sshd_config
